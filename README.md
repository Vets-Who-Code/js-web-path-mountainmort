# Introduction

1. **VQS Program.** The VetsWhoCode Qualification Standard (VQS) program is a qualification
system of basic training performance objectives (TPO) designed to establish the minimum level of
competency required for a member to successfully perform in their grade. This VQS is a compilation of
the minimum knowledge and skills that an individual must demonstrate in order to qualify for
advancement. The objective of VQS is to standardize and facilitate these qualifications.
1. **CONTENTS.** The VQS is divided into 12 sections. Each section is divided into subsections (issues list). The issues list can be found under the `Issues` tab of this Github Repository. TPOs can be found by clicking into individual issues in the issues list. Each TPO is formatted using the Army's formula for training tasks to standard as in the following:
    1. **Task:** A clearly defined and measurable activity accomplished by individuals. Tasks are specific activities that contribute to the accomplishment of encompassing requirements. Different types of Tasks are:
        1. **DEMONSTRATE.** Given a scenario members must physically demonstrate from memory and with references in the presence of a VQS qualifier the subject performance factor.
        1. **USE.** Members must demonstrate through a Github Pull Request, with the aid of appropriate references, the ability to complete standards using a specified tool.
    1. **Conditions:** The environment and boilerplate needed to perform the task.
    1. **Standard:** A list of the minimum acceptable proficiencies required in the performance of the training task under a specific set of conditions.
1. **VQS QUALIFIERS.** The VQS Qualifier is designated in writing by the Executive Director to sign off
individual VQS line items. Qualifiers will normally be field professionals, as a minimum, must have
completed the VQS they are authorized to sign off. The names of designated Qualifiers can be found on
the VQS Progress Chart or Command Qualifiers List.
1. **TRAINEE.**  You must demonstrate your knowledge to a designated VQS qualifier. You have one year
from the date of your first signature to complete this VQS. Failure to complete VQS within the one year
time limit will result in invalidation of those signatures that go beyond the time limit or in the invalidation of
the entire VQS. The requirements of this VQS may be satisfied through formal training or self-instruction.
If you have any questions or are unable to locate references, contact your mentor or qualifier. Good
Luck!
