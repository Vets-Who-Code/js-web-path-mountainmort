# My Favorite Podcasts
I spend a lot of time running, and while I'm on the trail or treadmill, podcasts are my go-to resource for entertainment, learning, and a little bit of distraction. 

Here are my go-tos by category:


## Technology
After being disconnected from the tech world for a couple years (well, mostly!), podcasts were the best way for me to get back in touch with the latest and greatest happening out there. I'm partial to the Javascript world so my top picks are skewed that direction, but I'll include a few more general choices.

### Javascript
1. [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/)
1. [Front End Happy Hour](https://frontendhappyhour.com/)

### Programming

1. [Code Newbie Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast)
1. [Compiler](https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast)

## Fitness
Fitness has always been a huge part of my life - playing sports since childhood, having Arnold's encylopedia and posters in my teens, and now using my fitness to advance my outdoor pursuits. Working out has always been the perfect recharge for my brain, but the content out there can be overwhelming to sift through. Here are recommendations of people I trust to sift through the noise:

### Running / Endurance Sports

1. [The Uphill Athlete Podcast](https://uphillathlete.com/podcast/)

## Self-Improvement
Personal growth is a lifelong journey and podcasts are one of the best formats from learning first-hand from some of the world's best performers. Rather than listening to specific podcasts, I tend to find a particular person I'm interested in - say an author, creator, etc. - then search for podcasts where they have been featured. Every interview can give you a bit different insight into their process. However, there a few podcasts that I tend to find interesting and their guest list is always a good starting point to find people worth being interested in.

1. [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/)
1. [The Growth Equation](https://thegrowtheq.com/gepodcast/)
1. [The Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/welcome-to-the-huberman-lab-podcast/)


## Entertainment 

### True Crime
I prefer entertainment of the morbid type - think true crime, dark web, and mysteries - or even better, all of the above!

### Gaming
Even though my wife wishes otherwise, what kind of nerd would I be if I didn't enjoy the occasional gaming? I don't have a ton of time to game these days, but I do like to keep up to date with what's happening out there. And as you'll notice, I tend to prefer games of the MMO variety - I can't keep up with the kids on the shooters these days!
